🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

The calculator display updates dynamically using JavaScript.

Button clicks call simple functions like:

appendToDisplay()

calculateResult()

clearDisplay()

Calculations are handled using basic JavaScript logic.

CSS is used only for UI and light animations (hover & press effects).

This approach keeps the code easy to read and explain.
